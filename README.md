# Modeling and Simulation (CSCI 74000) Final Project 
## Authors: Artjom Plaunov and Daniel Mallia

## Description

## Setup
This project assumes an installation of Python (>= 3.8.5) as well as the
packages in requirements.txt. To install them you can run:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

If any issues are encountered in installing using this requirments file
(possibly due to cross-platform compatibility issues), this project really only 
requires 4 packages: mesa, pandas, numpy and matplotlib. As long as you can set
up Python 3.8.5 (with which this was tested) and pip, then install these 4, you shouldn't encounter any problems.

## How to run
